The quality I seek in everything is simplicity, because it's the hardest quality to understand.

There's a common misconception simple and complex are opposites, but that's not quite right. The opposite of simple is complicated. But complex and complicated are not the same.

In watchmaking, anything except the hour and minute hand is called a "complication". Weekday, second hand, or phase of the moon all make the mechanism *more complicated* than it needs to be to tell time.

This doesn't mean a movement for a watch which only has hour and minute is not complex. You'll have all kinds of tiny parts fitted together in intricate ways to tight tolerance. Simplicity comes from leaving out everything unneccesary.

Science has a specific word for the opposite of complex: trivial. Sometimes only one word truly fits to describe a situation accurately. In those cases, using the more specific word is not a complication; it's essential to clear communication. Simple, but complex.

In writing, people often fall into a trap of using more complicated words than necessary. They hope the words will make their subject more complex. Instead they only make the message less clear.

The process of weeding out the unnecessary words requires great effort, because it's a process of figuring out what you truly, deeply, want, and that's the hardest question to answer.

Simple ain't easy.
