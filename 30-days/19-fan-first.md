A few years ago, everybody was urged to learn how to code. Well, that's wrong, some people shouldn't.

Mark Mothersbaugh from Devo tells a story about playing Max's Kansas City, a legendary late 70s punk club in NYC. Devo was getting big, and there was a rumor John Lennon was coming that night.

After the show, Mark's sitting in the van with the window open, when a face pops up in his grill: it's Lennon, screaming the "yeah yeah yeah yeah" intro from their song 'Uncontrollable Urge'. He says, "I could have died and gone to heaven."

Lennon was always a fan. He was never shy about expressing his love for other music, from Chuck Berry to T. Rex. Paul, George and Ringo were fans too.

You've got to love coding. Don't get into it if you don't. The money just isn't worth it.

Here's a dirty secret in the industry: a subset of the population doesn't have the conceptual ability needed to program. There are lots of working programmers who don't know what they're doing. They copy and paste code randomly until it works, maybe hitting up their friend for help.

You might not like Devo's style, but believe it or not, their music is fairly technically challenging. There are some folks who have no musical ability, but they're usually limited in their reach.

Once in a while, you have to watch someone who is not a proper musician struggle to complete a song. It can be tremendously painful to witness. Maybe these folks love their music and their coding, but it's got to be so hard.

This is the definition of talent: put your efforts where they're best served. It doesn't help the world to have kickass programmers working as mediocre musicians or vice versa. It's good to pursue your dreams, don't give it up, but you should do the thing you're really good at.

Be a fan first. Support people you like. Do it for yourself second, do what you love. Then do what you're the best at for everyone.
