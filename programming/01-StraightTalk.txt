Listen, I'm not going to bullshit you. Software development isn't easy. 

There's a line of software development books called "Learn [X language] in 24 hours!". They twist the meaning almost immediately; what it really means is twenty four one hour lessons. 

Everybody promises to make it easy to learn software development! But it's about as successful as promises to burn stubborn belly fat with this one weird trick! 
It's just a matter of the wrong definition. 

Software development is like Super Mario Brothers. 

Some people never finished Super Mario Brothers, and that's okay! Some people never get past the third or fourth level. They kind of repeat themselves after that point anyway. 

Maybe you found the warp zones and the vine up to coin heaven. Maybe you're a speed runner. Or maybe you get into level design and platformer mashup. 

Software development is a practice, like music or exercise. It's as hard as you want it to be. But most people want to be good, so we make it hard. 

The trick is to not make it any harder than it has to be.
