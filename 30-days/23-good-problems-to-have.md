Three quarters through this 30 day project, let's take a pause to review.

First, thank you for reading. I appreciate your time.

At the beginning of this project, I said it was going to be about practice and uncertainty. And I feel it has been. Some of the uncertainty has been how I adapt to the practice.

Choosing what to write about poses the biggest challenge. I had a lot of topics prepared beforehand, but I didn't write them all out first. I wanted to see where the writing went.  As Dave Grohl says about the Foo Fighters' practice attitude: "If it gets any better, it'll get worse." Leave room for it to grow. Practice uncertainty.

But it's not just what I want, it's about you too. It's gotta be useful, and enjoyable.

People ask how I put myself out in public. Not gonna lie, it's not easy. But it's hard to keep it all to yourself too. When an elite practicioner blows you out of the water, it's still hard for them. The difference is "hard for them" produces more results than "hard for you".

If it's gonna be hard anyways, might as well pick the kind of hard that produces results you like. Having to deal with success is still hard, but maybe you might like that kind of hard better.

That's where habits come in. What you practice determines what problems.
