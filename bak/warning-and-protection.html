    <h1>Warning and Protection</h1>
    <p>Everyone agrees ignorance is bliss. Why? Because we've all experienced the opposite, where knowledge has brought discomfort.</p>
    <p>Knowledge is power, and power isn't free. You pay the cost in discomfort when you have to adjust your mind to a new concept.</p>
    <p>Some concepts are so new, so different, the cost of absorbing them passes beyond discomfort into pain. If the cost seems too great, sometimes a mind will reject an idea as a defense mechanism.</p>
    <p>A mind can reject an idea calmly if it has sufficient information. If I suggested the Sun will rise from the North tomorrow, you could dismiss it without another thought. The Sun always rises in the East, there's no doubt about that.</p>
    <p>But if I suggested the Sun isn't going to rise tomorrow, that provokes a different response. We know daytime gets shorter over the winter, and eclipses can block the Sun's light, so even though it's never failed to happen before, it seems more possible. The possiblity creates a crack for doubt to get in. Doubt often leads to fear, and anger is a natural reaction.</p>
    <p>Whenever anyone gets angry, about anything, there is some idea they are resisting. Something they don't like, something they're afraid of. These are often the deepest truths capable of revealing the most. Whenever someone gets angry, it's worth it to try to understand why. With others, that's not always possible, but it is with ourselves. </p>
    <p>Whenever I get angry, about anything, I ask myself 'why' five times. From struggling with a computer problem to having a musical disagreement to reading politics, nothing has given me more insight.</p>
    <p>Follow the anger far enough, and it will lead you to truth. </p>
