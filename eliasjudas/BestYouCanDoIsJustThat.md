I have a couple of dogs who I learn from constantly.

The smaller one, Stella, is constantly harassed by the big one, Polly. Basically, Polly likes to play more than Stella does, so she'll use her size to bully and antagonize Stella until the little dog's patience runs out. Stella unleashes the fury only a Schnauzer mix can, a fusillade of barks followed by a surprisingly agile chase and intrepid, tenacious wrestling. 

Over the years, it's evolved into what seems a familiar and comfortable relationship; Stella seems to relish her role as the strict disciplinarian to Polly's wild party girl antics. Polly seems to know how far Stella can be pushed, and backs off when things get too hot. At twenty five pounds or so, this isn't the first time Stella's gotten bossed around by a bigger dog (Stella is twelve years old to Polly's six). 

You'd think that having to stand up for yourself every day would give the little dog a sense of rooting for the underdog (pun intended), but the opposite is true. When Stella gets the chance to push around a dog smaller than her, she immediately tries to take advantage of it.

This doesn't make Stella a bad dog. Dogs have some capacity for self-control, which can be maximized through training, but it's still finite. Expecting the dog to have some ability that they don't, whether it's reacting to another dog on the street or reading the newspaper, simply makes you look foolish. The dog can do what the dog can do, and your feelings about how the dog should behave make no difference. 

People are the same. They have a finite capacity for patience, self awareness, empathy, restraint; and that capacity diminishes greatly when they're tired, hungry, afraid. 

So often, we look at other people and expect them to demonstrate a greater capacity than they do. We aren't able to take into account factors we can't see: their physical condition, their life experiences, their childhood trauma. 

Weightlifiting has a concept of a 'personal record'. This guy from Iceland recently broke the world record for a deadlift at eleven hundred pounds; but we are not him, and can't be judged by his standards. The personal record is the best that you can do.

Everyone is doing the best they can do. Some people's best isn't very much, but it doesn't make them bad people.

Cut other people some slack, as you would like to have some slack cut for you.
