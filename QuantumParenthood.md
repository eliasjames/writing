Quantum Mechanics has an interpretation which coined the phrase, "observation affects outcome". In QM, this interpretation leads to mysticism: the cat that is both alive and not-alive, the particles that aren't there until they're looked for.

However, taken quite literally, it has application and insight for everyday life.

Watching is not a passive activity. When the watcher receives information about the watched, both of them are changed forever.

Parents scar their children no matter what they do. Anyone can see the effect of absentee parents. But at the other extreme, overly involved, so-called "helicopter" parents can cripple a child equally.

Scars can't be avoided, because all parents are themselves children. Still learning.

In a video game, you can relive a life over and over to get it just right. In this life, the warmup is also the final. We have to make mistakes to explore the boundary between what works and what doesn't. The test limits the results.

Observation affects the outcome.
