I practice breathing whenever I remember.

Not the physical act - we all do that every minute. What I practice is not taking breathing for granted.

One day, I will want to take a breath, and I won't be able to. When that happens, I'm really going to regret all the times I could take a deep, clean, breath, and I wasted that moment on some negative feeling. Wishing I had something, wishing the world was different.

All negative feelings come from ingratitude. So when I feel a negative feeling, I remind myself I can breathe, and that's pretty good.

As I breathe in, I ask for forgiveness, for everything. For wasting time on negative emotion, for failing to do unto others, for whatever.

As I breathe out, I allow myself to be forgiven. To do good in the world, I have to get up and face it every day. And I can't do that with a feeling of guilt. Only love.

Take a breath now, feel how good it is. Remember that feeling.
