If you've ever had the fortune
To contemplate a real peach
It felt like two weeks in July
When still the days lie
As the sweetness of death
Steeps in the flesh and it waits
Until the bough breaks
And with sinful heft falls
Near where with half-lidded eyes
Lip half bit
Hair spread like a fan
All God's creatures born to die
Get on with it!

See the way I twist, you, baby
Twist you like you wanna be
See the way I twist, you, honey

Still the days lie about
How each bite dissolves
Even the memory of the last
The old piece replaced by the new flame
Until you're not sure
There's anything
You've ever really grasped

Still the days lie, as
All we play out
They encode
In a night's muggy buzz
Like the solstice is the last summer day lying
Like a smile holds a secret
Show me yours!

See the way I twist, you, baby
Twist you like you wanna be
See the way I twist, you, honey

See the way I twist, you, baby
Twist you like you wanna be
See the way I twist, you, honey

You're my sweet Persephone!

Persephone!
You're my sweet Persephone!
Persephone!
Persephone!
Persephone!
My love for you is anarchy...
Persephone!
