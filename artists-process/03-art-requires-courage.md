Having an artist's process will improve anyone's life.

An artist experiments on the unmeasurable. Science limits itself to repeatable experiments; appreciating a work of art repeatedly produces a different result each time.

With repeatable experiments, the result can be predicted with confidence. When a high school physics class performs the oil drop experiment, they're not going to get a different value for the charge of the electron.

Since art depends on people's preferences, unpredictable reactions are commonplace. Release nine versions of your software to crickets, and then the tenth explodes. Love, hate, or equal polarization: the reason why can hide deeply.

Courage consists of acting in the face of fear. The artist can never know what reaction their work will provoke.

The artist's process requires learning how to act in the constant unknown.

Every work of art is an act of courage.
