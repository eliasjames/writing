One catastrophe deserves another
Wreckage relentlessly smashes days in daze
You and I, this thing called past, we
Endlessly discover
Repeating differently, we're
Constantly amazed

In a dirty wind out of Eden, even
Wings get smothered
Feeding on entropy, gaze in distant haze
Angel of History
Doomed to watch and suffer
Falling Backwards endlessly, he
Blazes progress' maze

Into the Future
We act like actors

Did those feet in ancient times
Walk on mountains green?
And was the holy lamb of God
In pleasant pastures seen?
And did Countenance Divine
Shine on clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among Satanic mills?

Into the Future
We act like actors
Into the Future
We're all Falling Backwards

We're all Falling Backwards

We're all Falling Backwards
