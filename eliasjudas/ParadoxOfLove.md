I believe in the paradox of love: love is weakness which makes us strong. 

I say believe, because like the existence of God or UFOs, love can't really be proven. There's no experiment we can perform (yet?) to determine whether or not love exists. 

Evidence for the paradox surrounds us though. Look at some phrases so common, we never question them:

Ignorance is bliss, and knowledge is power. What you don't know won't hurt you, until you learn a painful lesson, but whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

As ignorance and knowledge are opposites, so are power and bliss. To achieve any kind of power - book smarts or street smarts, physical strength or spiritual strength - requires subjecting yourself to discomfort. The discomfort of admitting you don't know, of admitting you can't handle all the weight, of admitting your limits.

I think about some things as "baller problems" - good problems to have. Nice car? Pricey maintenance. High income? Have to hire accountants and advisors. Exciting career? Constant danger of losing it all. Jay-Z raps about turning down the Super Bowl halftime show. How difficult must that have been? To have to pass on such an epic opportunity... because you believe passing will yield even greater rewards. 

Baller problems are the kinds of problem we'd all like to have, for sure. But they're still problems. Along with the possibility for great success must come the possibility for great failure. Risk nothing, gain nothing. 

Love is a risk. To love is to make yourself vulnerable, putting part of your inside, outside. When you love something, you get hurt... and then you try again. 

Everything successful in life follows this formula: get hurt, and try again. Exercise only improves fitness through controlled damage. Kids' immune systems needs to be exposed to allergens in order to grow healthy. To improve in music, you have to honestly examine your shortcomings, and change your practice. Computer programming practice requires the same examination and change.

Love demonstrates itself through change. Change is risky and uncomfortable.

When someone you love hurts you, they start to make it right by apologizing. They ask you to risk getting hurt again. But love demands more than apologetic words, it demands change. To love yourself, you must sometimes risk losing others, if they're not committed to undergoing the discomfort.

Love _is_ risk. Love _is_ discomfort.

Make yourself vulnerable, get hurt, and then change.
