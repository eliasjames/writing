Every aspect of life has a moral component to it, and programming is no exception. 

I believe in love and kindness towards all living things. But this doesn't mean I'm a shrinking doormat who hides from discomfort. On the contrary, love requires you to face discomfort.

If something or someone you love has a problem, the first step is to acknowledge it. My grandfather was a well-known psychiatrist, and he coined a phrase which is famous in the   in the addiction/recovery community in a slightly modified form:

You're only as sick as your secrets.

To truly love, to honor what you love, you must bring secrets out into the light. Wounds fester and rot in darkness; sunlight is the greatest disinfectant. 

In this spirit of honor and love, I am going to share one of my secrets; and I also have to call out a moral failure in the programming community, not from judgement or negativity, but because I love my fellow programmers and I can't stand to see their sickness continue to cause harm. 

I only met my grandfather once. Even at seven years old, I could tell he was deeply unhappy, and several months later, he took his own life. My earliest memories of many of my family members come from attending his funeral. 

Although grandfather was a successful psychiatrist, he did not have success in healing himself; and he damaged my mother in some deep and precise way that only a professional could. 

Mom tried to love me as best as she could, but her best was limited. As happens naturally, she was drawn to the damage within my Dad, and I grew up in a very unhealthy and difficult environment. 

In my early teens, I started experimenting with drugs and alcohol, and went way down fast. Two chance events when I was 15 changed my life: Dad's job moved us across the country, giving me a chance to start over; and I was introduced to the "straight edge" subculture of punk rock, which rejected all drugs, alcohol and sex, and emphasized a discipline of personal moral responsibility. 

I didn't follow Straight Edge perfectly, but it gave me a framework to reject peer pressure, and I with a handful of exceptions, I stayed sober from 15 until my early 20s, when I started to gradually reintroduce alcohol and marijuana into my life. 

From my early 20s until a few years ago, my relationship to those substances, while not healthy, qualified as what they call "highly functional". My career went great, my wife and I have been together for almost 20 years, we have a great relationship with our child, good friends and family.

Recently I got tired of maintaining that functional relationship. I've worked with therapists pretty consistently since 2013, but since my substance use has stayed consistently low-level and free of external problems, we've mostly focused on other issues that were more pressing. 

I wanted to address the sense of compulsion associated with my substance habit. As minor as it was - I averaged about 2 drinks per day, and spent less than $500 a year on weed - I couldn't shake the feeling that I *had* to do it, and I wanted to change that. 

I knew the first thing I had to do was reset, to start by eliminating all substances from my life. I chose a period of 30 days, because I also knew that rigidly forbidding myself from ever using again was sure to backfire ("What you resist, persists", as Carl Jung put it).

A few days later, I told my therapist about this initiative. She recommended a book called "30 Days To Sobriety" by Jack Canfield and Dave Andrews, mentioning that the initial steps of their system aligned very closely with the steps I'd already taken. I checked the book out and thought it looked promising. I also realized I hadn't marked the calendar at the beginning of my 30 days or otherwise noted my progress, so I thought the daily exercises in the book would be a great way to progress through the month. 

The book was a disaster on day one.

Their method has followers choose a date to quit drinking, and then do some steps to get ready for day one, such as starting a journal, and visiting a doctor to prepare for the physical effects of withdrawal from severe alcohol abuse. I was already ahead of schedule on those tasks, except one. 

The book has a companion website, https://the30daysolution.com. One of the tasks was to visit the website and perform an exercise called "time travel". This website was one of the worst - quite likely *the* worst - online experience I've ever had. 

- The link to the website in the Kindle version of the e-book went to the wrong place - http://day1.solutions, which appears to be an unauthorized "squatter" or placeholder website.
- I searched through the e-book for the location to the companion website, but it it was never referenced directly except for the broken links. The "Resources" section of the e-book mentions http://30DayResources.com, but that domain has no DNS registration (Firefox reports this error as "Hmm. We're having trouble finding that site.")
- I searched for "30 day solution" and saw https://www.the30daysolution.com/ in the results. After loading the page, it appeared to be from the same source as the book, although my confidence was now shaken. The site required user registration to access the companion materials, including personal details like email address, which I didn't love, but grudgingly accepted.
- I filled out the required fields on the registration form and clicked submit, and got a popup with a message. The message was technical jargon which I recognized as basically saying, "jQuery error", but would have been complete nonsense to anyone who's not a web developer. Since the error was client-side, I clicked submit again. Now the email field showed an error message, "Email already in use". Okay, so, can I log in? I opened that link in a separate tab, and yes, I could.  
- The logged-in landing page is heavy with inaccessible design - "inaccessible" meaning design that a visually impaired user would have a hard time navigating. There's a large image of a pleasant sunrise over the ocean, but the main navigation at the top of the page uses a slightly lighter shade of the same blue color as the sky. For a visually impaired user, those links could be very difficult to see. At the bottom of the picture, there's an area that contains scrolling text, which again can be difficult to handle for some users. Text on a web page should never, ever move. 
- None of the links at the top of the page, or scrolling down the page, have the initial "time travel" exercise. I clicked several levels into the site to "Day 1" content and it's not there either. The only search function I could find was for the member forums, and a search there didn't provide it either. 
- Speaking of forums, halfway down the landing page is a section labelled "View the Most Recent Topics & Newest Members". It shows five "Recent Topics", all of which are clearly spam, such as "Up to 9% off cheap wow classic gold eu on wowclassicgp as 2020 Father's Day cele" by user wowclassicgold74 from 2 days ago. I now have zero confidence that my (potentially painfully private) data is secure on this site. 
- The scrolling text on the beach says "Let us know how we're doing using the feedback form", but has no link. Using the browser's text search within the page first finds a section that says "You can find the feedback form in the lower right corner of every page." Scrolling to the bottom of the page, I find a link that says, not 'feedback', but "Support". I guess that's it...
- The support page has text front and center that says "Open a Support Ticket", but that text isn't a link. I see videos labeled "DASHBOARD WALK-THROUGH" and "DAILY WALK-THROUGH" (all-caps text is considered on the web to be equivalent to shouting). Scrolling down, there's a section that shouts "QUESTIONS? To open a ticket with The 30-Day Support Staff use the button in the lower left corner of this page labeled "SUPPORT." There is no button in the lower left hand corner, but for the first time, I notice a small (74x14px) button labelled "Feedback" on the *right hand* side of the page. Next to "QUESTIONS?" is "SUPPORT GUIDES" which launches a new tab to a "Help Center no longer exists" page on zendesk.com.
- Clicking the "Feedback" button opens a form asking for name, summary, and a choice of feedback type, but also email address, even though I provided that during registration, and I'm still logged in. The form starts off "For support related issues see 30day.support" - which is the broken link to zendesk mentioned above. Worse still, the form goes on to say, "This form is for feedback only, and although we will absolutely review your feedback (and greatly appreciate it), we do not respond to all submissions." You're about to get my email address - AGAIN - but you can't be bothered to send me a canned response, and instead make me feel like I'm inconveniencing you when YOU ASKED FOR FEEDBACK on the landing page. 
Yes, I'm shouting in all caps there. I can't tell you how upset I am at this web experience. Recently I had a mildly irritating experience with simplehuman.com, but whatever, I can buy my trash bags from many other places. 

https://www.the30daysolution.com/ is supposed to be a resource for people who want to change their lives by reducing their dependence on alcohol. I'm thinking of a severe drinker, taking the courageous first steps to change his life, who has visited his doctor, started a journal and completed all the other steps. With fingers shaking from sober detox jitters he visits this site as instructed; with eyes shaking from sober detox jitters he tries to read the moving text and search for the "time travel" instruction... and that's assuming he was able to perservere past the login errors!

This web site is a moral abomination. There is an unspoken contract between programmers and their users, that the former will keep the latter safe and respect their experience. This web site spits in the face of that contract. And we're not talking about selling trash bags here, we're talking about people's lives. 

If I had any confidence that the feedback form would get reviewed, I would have kept this private, but I have never had less confidence in the integrity of a site than this one. So I have no choice to share this publically. 

To Jack Canfield, Dave Andrews, and whoever is responsible for programming the30daysolution.com, take this site down immediately. Your ignorant negligence is doing harm to the very people you claim to want to help. The scrolling text on the landing page asks us to "be patient during this initial beta launch", but slapping a "beta" label on harmful software doesn't excuse you from your responsibility, just as ignorance does not. If you don't want to put in the work to have a site that meets minimum requirements then don't have one at all. 

I say this from a place of both anger and love. I want you to help people and I believe that you do as well.
