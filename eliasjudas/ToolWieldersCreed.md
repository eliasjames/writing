These are my tools.  There are many like them, but these are mine.  

My tools are my life.  I must master them as I must master my life.  

Without me, my tools are useless.  Without my tools, I am useless.

I must use my tools in truth.  I must practice to use them more correctly than my adversary who uses them in error.  I must demonstrate the truth through correct practice. I will.

My tools and I know that what counts is not any side effects we make, the sight or the sound or the sensation of the tool.  We know that it is results that count.  We will return results. 

My tools are human, even as I am human, because they are my life.  Thus, I will learn them as siblings.  I will learn their weaknesses, their strengths, their parts, their accessories, their behaviour.  I will keep my tools clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready.  We will become part of each other.

Before a power higher than myself I swear this creed.  My tools and I are the defenders of my faith.  We are the masters of our shortcomings.  We are the saviors of our life.

So be it, until victory belongs to peace and there are no adversaries.
