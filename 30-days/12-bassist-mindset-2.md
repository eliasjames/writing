Rock music is a sub-genre of jazz. Jazz for punks.

These terms, jazz and punk, have taken on different meanings over the years. But musicians know terms, genre labels, definitions are not the same thing as the music they refer to. Let's look at some examples.

In 1966, two bands found out they were using the name "The Warlocks", one in NY and one in SF. Both had long hair, dressed all in black, and played acid-fuzz blues drones.

They changed their names, respectively, to the Velvet Underground and the Grateful Dead.

The Velvets and the Dead had a lot more in common back then than you might think. The Velvets' first gig outside of NYC was opening for the Allman Brothers. And the Dead played a series of gigs with Miles Davis as he started to enter his dark electric period.

All of these bands had strong bassists who treated their instrument as a lead as often as support. And all of them also set themselves apart from mainstream society. That's not a coincidence.

Punk eventually came to refer to an aesthetic and a genre, but at first it was an insult. Like Dirty Harry's famous line, "Do you feel lucky, _punk?_"

Jazz began as the music of outsiders - first created by blacks in New Orleans who had received classical music training, when a change in the law forbade them from playing for white audiences. They mixed their classical knowledge with the traditional styles and came up with something no one knew what to do with.

The outsider element and mixing of cultures persisted. Ritchie Valens introduced latin elements to rock'n'roll with "La Bamba" - featuring the legendary bassist Carole Kaye. Later Kira Roessler, wearing an evening gown, played tough but intellectual bass for hardcore punks Black Flag (also well-documented Grateful Dead fans).

God gave rock 'n' roll to everyone. All the weirdo misfit black punks. Even the bassists.
