This wraps the post a day project - thanks for reading along. I'm not done writing, but I'll scale back to once or twice a week.

See, contrary to what I said the other day, I never quit. Just change.

Humans evolved as "persistence hunters". The only things humans can do better than other animals are jog and sweat. But it turns out, on the African Savannah, those two things combine to make a lethal pack. Average herd prey can run in bursts as fast as a car, but can't sustain that pace for long. Eventually the prey collapses from heat exhaustion, and the gang beats it to death with nothing more than rocks and sticks.

We exist because we persist.

I persist in wrestling with Hemingway's rule: "Write one true thing. Write the truest thing you know."

Here's one true thing: nothing ends, only changes.

They say you are what you eat. That's literally true. We're made of nothing but the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe.

So we're made up of the energy of all the plants and animals that came before us, and as their energy turned into ours, someday our energy will turn into another form.

Balancing today against tomorrow is the most basic human problem. We don't know how many of each we have - uncertainty. And until we know how many, we have to keep going - practice. But as we repeat we learn, and as we learn, we don't do the same things - change.

Practice uncertainly, then change.

Again, thank you for reading. If you enjoyed it, please tell your friends.
