What am I _doing?_

It's the hardest question to answer. And the most important. You only get one life, what do you want to do with it?

I'm writing 30 posts in 30 days. Why?

First and foremost, I want to give back. I have a gift for explaining complex technical concepts in simple terms. This has made me pretty successful in many different areas, and I want to share.

But what areas? "They" say you should specialize in some established subject. I've tried that, and it bores me so much I quit.

I'm a lifelong musician. It means a tremendous amount to me and I'll never stop. But it's not everything. Music gives me insight into other parts of my life.

I'm a software developer. Lots of people don't realize software development is a creative act - it's a form of writing, but using numbers instead of words.

Becoming a better software developer has made me a better musician, and vice versa. In fact all the disciplines I practice, from bicycling to scientific buddhism, have influenced and improved each other.

When you practice, you conduct little science experiments with your own life. What happens if I try it this way instead? No improvement. Try something else. Repeat.

Practice reduces our discomfort with uncertainty. I believe dealing with uncertainty is at the root of the human condition.

And I'm hoping to start a conversation. What are _you_ doing? I look forward to hearing it.

Peace,

Elias
