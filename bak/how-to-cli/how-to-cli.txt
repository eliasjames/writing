How To Use the Linux CLI

The power of the Linux CLI comes from its basis in text: throughput and 
accuracy. Higher throughput because key presses contain more information than 
clicks; higher accuracy because parameter values must be explicitly stated.

Like a language, in order to become fluent with the CLI, you have to learn a 
few of the most common terms for actions (i.e., verbs). Here's a list of those 
actions for the CLI:
- show a directory
- show a file's contents 
- compare two files 
- find a file
-- by name
-- by content


Show a directory

Lots of people know the 'ls' command shows the contents of directories. What
many don't know is 'ls' can show contents on any directory, not just the 
current one. 

Without an argument, 'ls' shows the current directory. 'ls' takes as its first argument the path to the directory to list. 

'ls /Users/eliascarlston'

This form of the command works from anywhere within the operating system 
because it uses an absolute path - it starts with a '/', indicating the root 
directory. 

It would be tiring to have to use the absolute path to our home directory all 
the time, so we have a magic word:

'ls ~'

'~' transforms into "the home directory of the current user". Text after the 
transformation interprets as if it was typed by the user:

'ls ~/writing' works the same as
'ls /Users/eliascarlston/writing'

Although intuitive, it's best not to think of CLI commands as being "typed" in
the sense of replacing strings of characters. Instead, commands are interpreted
in an order of operations, like a math expression. Look what happens when magic 
word '~' combines with '..', which means "the directory above":

'ls ~/..' shows the contents of '/Users' 

When they combine, '~' replaces to '/Users/ecarlston' and '..' references 
"the directory above" 'ecarlston'.
