You may not be interested in physics, but some concepts can change how you look at life. One is spacetime.

Spacetime means constant change.

When you hear "spacetime" in science fiction, it's someone yelling about "violating the space-time continuum". It sounds complicated and mysterious, but while the math is complex, the concept doesn't have to be.

Space-time simply means you can't talk about one without talking out the other. In everyday use, we talk about them separately, but it turns out that's not correct.

Look, sometimes common sense is wrong. I wake up in the morning and watch the sun rise out the window. But it doesn't really rise, does it? I should say I wake up and watch the Earth rotate, changing its relative position to the Sun.

Doesn't quite roll off the tongue, but it also _feels_ wrong. It feels like I'm sitting still.

But nothing has ever sat still. You also can't talk about separately about space-time and motion. Everything is constantly moving.

Earth rotates, and the Earth orbits the Sun, and the Solar system orbits the Milky Way.

Imagine a clock on the wall. Common sense says it's staying still. But if you put cosmic smoke trails on the hands, they would trace out spirals, like a gymnast with a ribbon, as the clock and the wall and the whole neighborhood scream through space at 78,000 miles per hour.

Common sense says, "I woke up in the same place this morning, in the same house." Not right. It's not in the same place, but it's not quite the same house either. Some organic molecules have decayed, that crack you spotted last week is one micron larger.

Everything is in a constant state of change. Nothing ever stays the same, even for a second.

Accepting change helps a lot, since it's inevitable.

Spacetime changes.
