Software development is simple, but it's not easy. 

The most important thing is to be clear. If the cause of the current behavior is not clear, there's no way you're going to fix or improve on it. 

The process of implementing software is like performing a piece of music. There exists a perfect, ideal performance for every piece of music, but you will never, ever, get there. Only closer. You learn so much, but you never finish. 

But the clearer you get, the farther you can see. There's pros and cons to everything, but I believe seeing more clearly is better than seeing less clearly. 

Nothing is more important in software development than clarity.
