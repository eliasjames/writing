Sometimes things are secret just because no one talks about them. Here's a thing I think everybody could benefit from hearing. 

I was thinking about our divisive social climate, all our deep disagreements, and I started to get bummed out. Then my programmer problem solving habits started to kick in. If I can't solve a problem top-down, often I can solve it bottom-up.

So I asked, what are things we can all agree on? What are the most universal truths?

The first one is gravity. No one can fly. It doesn't matter whether you believe Newton, Einstein or John Mayer - if you jump off a tall place, you will fall to earth, and you'll risk serious injury (some people claim otherwise, but there's always a major condition attached, like it happened in the past but not anymore, or no one can be watching, etc).

Everybody had to be raised by someone. Not everyone knows who their parents are, but from birth up until age 5 or 6 humans are helpless. If you're alive, it means for a few years, someone took care of you.

Last, in every group that's large enough to have a name, people fall into three categories.

There's a small segment of devotees who believe deeply they're doing the right thing. They show up early and stay late, they provide help and encouragement to the rest of the group. Regardless of the group, these people tend to be caring and thoughtful, in their own way.

The bulk of the group is the silent majority. They're good people, but they usually don't have the energy or the courage to rock the boat and change its course. They show up and pitch in, but mostly their motivation is avoiding discomfort.

Then there's a small segment who want to use the group for their own selfish purposes: personal glory, grudges against other groups, whatever. These people can be very hard to identify; the differences between this group and the first are extremely subtle. This group is also very talented at "gaslighting": re-interpreting situations so that they always appear like they have the best interests at heart.

Conservatives and liberals, Christians and Atheists, programmers and business folks, punk rockers and squares. Every group has good and bad.

Our challenge used to be raw survival. The 20th century changed that. The great challenge in this millenium will be dealing with the trolls among us.
