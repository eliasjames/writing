The first time I heard the term "Econo", I'd been waiting for it my whole life. 

The punk band Minutemen coined the term to describe their approach to unconventional success in music business. Minutemen perfected the art of Do It Yourself music career pioneered shortly before by Black Flag. Both bands booked their own tours, loaded their own gear, and played shows all over America promoting records they produced and released themselves. 

It's a common misconception "Econo" means "cheap". Econo means "thrifty". Econo gets its name from the Ford Econoline vans these artists chose as reliable, workhorse transportation. 

But note none of them played cheap instruments. In old pictures, you'll only see Fenders and Gibsons, and even exotic, expensive models like Greg Ginn's Dan Armstrong guitar and Mike Watt's Rickenbacker bass. 

Watt described the influence of his father, a lifelong Navy mechanic, who encouraged him to spend extra to buy quality tools: "Otherwise it wears out quicker. Buy it twice? That ain't Econo."

A tour bus will get you and your gear from city to city in comfort about as good as most non-mobile domiciles. But they are breathtakingly expensive. Making a Faustian bargain with a record company could get you the tour bus, but the creative compromises and inhuman treatment involved might be more painful in the long run. 

Money makes things easy, and easy is not always good. Having a small budget forces you to ask the most painful and important question:

What is really important, and what is inessential?

The more accurately you can answer this question, the more success you'll have. Unfortunately the greatest source of misinformation on this subject comes from the same place as that answer. As Bob Dylan put it, "Funny how the things you have the hardest time parting with/Are the things you need the least".

Software development has the same characteristic. However, it's too often tolerated and even encouraged to make things more complicated than they need. Quality instruments are non-negotiable, but do you have to have gold-plated, custom built instruments? Over the years, I've had to formulate a method to cut through this Gordian Knot. 

Radical Simplicity simply asks if every thing is really important. Suspend both your cynicism and your hope and indulge your curiosity. Can we achieve the same result without this component or method? If so, then it has to go. 

These are hard questions, much harder than following conventional wisdom and infinitely harder than not asking. But the quality of the questioning process directly reflects in the final product. Everything worth doing is worth asking hard questions about.

Econo and Radical Simplicity are hard. But hard is good. 

Love hard.
