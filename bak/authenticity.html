    <h1>Authenticity</h1>
    <section>
      <p>I used to hate the term authenticity. It sounded pretentious and phony. But something changed and now nothing seems more true.</p>
      <p>When I was a kid, authentic had only one meaning to me: the process of being authenticated, of an authority declaring something was real. The opposite of authentic was counterfeit - money, brand name goods, ID cards, and so forth. </p>
      <p>At some point, authenticity gained another meaning. People started applying the term to other people, and I always had a negative reaction to it. Because whether the verdict was positive or negative, a judgement was always pronounced.</p>
      <p>The problem with sitting in judgement is the same as the problem with being the toughest kid on your block: chances are good you could get burned by the fire you're playing with. Judgement requires complete information, which is never possible but sometimes seems more achievable than others.</p>
      <p>No one can credibly comment on the authenticity of another person, because only one person in the world has the experience required to be an authority on the subject. Even your closest friends and relatives don't have access to the same experience you have had. </p>
      <p>The opposite of this means that since we are the sole experts on our lives, each one of us has a responsibility to pass that judgement on ourselves. The new meaning of authenticity to me is taking responsibility for your position as the sole authority on your life. The ultimate arbiter of genuineness. As the kids might put it, owning your weirdness.</p>
      <p>And I am a super weird guy. Depending on how you know me you may not see anything but a small part of it, but let's just say I entertain a lot of ideas which are not widely held. I haven't been able to write before because I have disliked confessionalism, thi style of revealing personal details about your life as part of an essay. But I couldn't figure out how to write *anything* without it.</p>
      <p>Hemingway had a famous quote for how to overcome writers' block, but it falls short. He said, "Just write one true sentence. Write the truest thing that you know." Beautiful, but lots of very true things are boring. I could tell you that the sum of the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the square of the other two sides - that's hella true. But it's not very original.</p>
      <p>I have a lot of ideas to share, which I think are pretty original, but I can't write about them without writing about myself. I want to write about the ideas because I think people will find them useful. I don't really want to write about myself but ultimately the ideas and their explanations may be inseparable. There's no way I can tell you about my original idea without explaining the context in which it came to me.</p>
      <p>So begins the process of authenticating myself: describing the world the way I see it. I hope you find it useful, and I hope I can make it enjoyable.</p>
      <p>First things first. Start with what is most important.</p>
