Here's a secret I used to be ashamed to admit: I believe in the paradox of love.

I've realized the shame came from our culture. We have a vague and misguided understanding of what love is.

Other languages have multiple words for different kinds of love: romantic, brotherly, aesthetic or preferential. We only have the one word, so we lump all the meanings together: I love my wife, but I also love programming, and chili cheese fries.

Some of the inaccuracy can be resolved by using different words: I enjoy chili cheese fries, while I am devoted to both my wife and the art of programming. But it's easy to forget that different words are different. There's something devotion and enjoyment and all other words fail to capture about love.

Romance confuses the concept of love. All of the stories that pretend to deal with romantic love actually deal with infatuation. Infatuation happens when two people first meet; the excitement, the constant presence in your thoughts, the sense of wonder.

Infatuation wears off. The romantic story ends when the couple settle down to live the rest of their lives together.

Romance ends where love begins, because love is hard as shit.

In my early days of programming, it hurt. Late late nights, banging my head on the wall of some code that wouldn't work. Get up in the morning and do it again. These days, it still hurts, just with advanced problems - architecture, clarity, acceptance.

Hurt, rinse, repeat. This is love.

My wife and I both had difficult childhoods. Learning to live, together, to both forgive and be gracious in forgiveness, has been incredibly difficult for both of us in different ways.

We get hurt, but then we come back and do it again.

Sometimes people confuse love with fear. They try to control situations beyond their grasp, like their partner's feelings or their children's ultimate safety. Or they become doormats, trying to appease every demand.

Fear of hurt avoids getting hurt, and therefore prevents love.

Even biology follows this law. Cells don't improve their fitness without adversity. Exercise is a process of slightly damaging your body. Young children need to be exposed to the pathogens in common, everyday dirt, or else they risk developing allergies. Older children not given the freedom to potentially get into trouble, or succeed greater than their parents, develop a stunted psychology.

We get hurt, and then we come back and do it again.

Ultimately, all love is self-love. Self-love doesn't mean eating a plate of chili cheese fries while procrastinating. It means trusting that after we get hurt, we'll be okay. The other side will be different, but also okay. We adapt to the adversity and we're fitter for it. It means forgiving and being forgiven. We despise in others what we dislike in ourselves.

Fear can keep us from seeing that truth. And the ultimate fear is death.

I don't think I truly loved, myself or others, until my brother died in '11. Part of letting him go required forgiving everyone, including myself.

Romance ends when the couple settles down. But love lasts forever. Death is a part of life, so to last forever, love must embrace it.

The paradox of love: to last forever, it has to be taken to its end. To feel incredible, it must feel terrible.

Get hurt, do it again.
