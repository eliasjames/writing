I wrote a piece earlier this week about the concept of "10x" in programming - the idea that some programmers are ten times more productive than the rest.

I got some pushback for the main statement I made: "10x programmers practice their art with ten times the love." I stand by this, but it does deserve more explanation.

There's a common misconception that programming is a science. It's not; it's an art. There's a huge technical component, for sure, but music shares this, and it's not a science.

It's meaningless to say one musician is "more productive" than another, because there are no appropriate measurements to compare. One singer might have a wider vocal range and produce more decibels at full volume, but we don't rank singers based on their numbers, as if they were athletes.

Think about a program you liked. It had quirks, but they were fine. Then the "big update" came out. It promised measurable improvement: better performance, more features.

The new version was worse. On paper, all the stats were better, but it no longer served its purpose as well. Your _feeling_ towards it soured.

The true measurement of a program's success depends on how people feel about it. That's what makes programming an art.

Making something people like is not the same as giving them what they ask for. A good programmer has to understand human nature, and have the discipline to give people the right thing. Just like a good musician doesn't "flex" their technical capabilities for their own sake - they play what the communication requires.

This combination of soft skills has little to do with the mechanics of technology. Instead, it represents a form of devotion to the craft. I wrote earlier this week that software belongs to its users. Writing software - notice that verb, an art - is an act of service.

All of this, just to rephrase without the "L" word: 10x programmers are ten times as devoted to serving their users.

I stand by that statement as much as the first, but it's a boat load less catchy, isn't it?
