Having the attitude of an artist will improve anyone's life.

Art is the science of subjective experience. An artist performs an experiment every time they create a work of art. Through investigating subjective experience, the artist performs an act of service to all people.

Every time an artist creates a work, they learn about themselves. And when the audience appreciates the work, the artist learns about the audience. These opportunities give insight into personal, subjective experience.

With objective, external science, the experiment should always be exactly the same. With subjective, internal experience, the experience can never be the same. No two people come to the experiment in exactly the same state.

But although the states can never be identical, they can be similar. Any artist worth their salt has a process, on which they execute variations. When a work provokes an unexpected reaction, the artist feels compelled to investigate, just like an unexpected result in the physical sciences.

Artistic experiments can't be compared the way quantitative experiments can. But they add to the sum of human knowledge the same way. The artist does well to remember their work constitutes an act of service.
