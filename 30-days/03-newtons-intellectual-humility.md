Physicist Eugene Wigner wrote a paper titled, "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Numbers". This effectiveness traces its history back to Isaac Newton. But while everyone focuses on the magical effects the numbers can produce, the secret genius of Newton's achievement hides in plain sight: an admission of ignorance.

At the time Newton wrote 'Principia', the question of whether the sun orbited the Earth or vice versa was wide open. Calculus closed the question. Newton's predictions of the motion of the planets was so much better than anything else it was unquestionable.

Newton knew he was on to something good. He also knew the issue of the orbit was extremely controversial. He chooses to address the controversy head on.

"Hypotheses non fingo", Newton wrote, 'I feign no hypotheses'. Newton didn't even try pretending _explaining_ what gravity was. He just found a hella excellent way to _describe_ it.

Newton's description was so good, other people were able to milk it for insight for 250 years. But it was only able to gain traction in the first place because he admitted he couldn't talk about *how* it worked, none of the *why*.

This leads us to our current situation. We have the 'how' in droves, we're drowning in 'how', but we're starving for 'why?'.

Art and science both approach the boundary between what's known and unknown, but from different directions. Newton called his approach 'experimental philosophy': "In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction." Or as I like to tell junior developers: prove it. Don't pontificate to me about why something is behaving a particular way, find a way to demonstrate it.

There are facts, determined by demonstrations, and there are feelings. But feelings have an inordinate influence on the expectations and interpretation of demonstrations. Turns out facts and feelings overlap pretty significantly. Changing one requires changing the other.

Anything starts with admitting you don't know everything.
