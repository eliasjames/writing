Most things in life repeat, like a theme and variations.

We glorify the variations and scorn the repetition. Our loss. Variations are exciting and memorable, but life exists in repetition.

A single day resembles an entire life. You wake and prepare, before leaving safety and comfort to venture into the world. Get to work, punctuated by rest, detoured by surprises. Tire, and turn to enjoying the result of your labor. Eventually you become too tired for even enjoyment, and consciousness fades.

Music consists of repetition at many different levels. Each time you listen to a piece of music is a repetition. Within a piece of music, melodies and rhythms repeat. The physical act of sound, oscillation, only exists while repeating.

Like the best music deserves repeated listens, so anything worth doing is worth repeating.

Computer programs appear like fluid magic on the surface, wildly variable. But underneath the computer repeats dull arithmetic. Writing computer programs well requires a disciplined set of habits that you perform the same way every time.

To get good at life, get good at repetition.

Practice practice.
