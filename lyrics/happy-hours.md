Chuck said to meet
Is more exciting than parting
But you got to part
To not let your heart harden
You've got to leave
Today behind tomorrow
You've got to leave
Both the joy and the sorrow

I've got to run
To keep from hiding
I've got to laugh
To keep from crying
I've got to live
To keep from dying
But I'm sure as hell
Not gonna give up trying

All my life I've lived like
Someone else's dream
All my life I've known things were not
What they seem!

Happy hours
They seems so long
How can some short moments mean so much
Happy hours
They feel so raw
When I know
In a moment
This could all be gone
