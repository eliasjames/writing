Everything I have seen and heard and learned has led me to the conclusion there is no good or bad in this world. For every pro you throw at me I can find a con - and vice versa. Lots of people have some personal attachment to the world tending positive or negative, but the world doesn't care about your opinion, it just is.

The modern age presents unique challenges. We are living in a time of unprecedented change, and change is difficult. But it's also an age of unprecedented peace - there are fewer wars going on today than at any time in history. Part of the reason is the green revolution of the 1970s, which made huge progress in improving the crop yields of farmers the world over. This proved critical to feeding the world population, which exploded at the same time from a corresponding decrease in infant mortality. No reasonable person can argue that we should avoid taking steps to prevent children from dying. Without adequate food though, that increase could have been a recipe for disaster. Revolution looks much more attractive to those with empty stomachs.

All that crop yield and less war stuff sounds positive, but then I could argue all those extra people now consume more natural resources, which contributes to this being the most environmentally damaging era in human history. I can keep going, back and forth, argument and counter argument. You can't prove to me that the world is going to hell, or everything's guaranteed to end in glory either. It is what it is, pros and cons.

Don't wallow in despair, don't deceive yourself in manufactured ecstasy. Just be what you need to be.
