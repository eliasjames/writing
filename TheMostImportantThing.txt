My mother passed away last year, and I've become super aware of my own mortality.

One consequence of this has been a desire to share what I have to offer. If there is something worth saying that's not being said, you should speak up. 

Sometimes things are not being said because no one has ever thought of them before. These are super rare. If you have something that to the best of your knowledge truly has not been thought of, you have a very strong obligation to share that. 

But sometimes things are not being said because someone already thought about them and realized there was a danger associated with it. The danger might be factual, but way more often it's social and emotional. 

People, including me, can be threatened by new ideas. New ideas can bring change, and change can often be painful.

I have found that every time an idea has made me angry, it threatens something I am afraid of, or makes me confront something about myself I don't like. 

I have seen when other people become angry about ideas, they're showing me their secrets, their weaknesses. 

The most important idea I can share I can't take credit for: if something makes you angry, ask yourself why.
