I said I don't believe in the concepts of 'good' and 'bad'. I did not say I don't believe in right and wrong. 

There's two definitions of right and wrong. One is moral, in the sense of righteousness or being wronged. The other refers to the state of correctness, how you did on the quiz. 

I think they're the same thing.

Accounting has a concept called 'externalities'. Externalities are expenses related to the business, that the business doesn't have to pay. Coal miners dump their slag into nearby streams and rivers under an EPA exemption. There's still a cost associated; the towns downstream from the mines have astounding rates of cancer. But the business doesn't have to pay it. 

Another way externalities can be defined is with the phrase, "Not my problem." I suggest that phrase is 'wrong': incorrect in every situation. 

When you walk past someone in the street, asking for help, are you surprised to come back and find your car stereo stolen? Without stable economies and food supplies, developing nations are much more receptive to anti-USA ideologies. Oh and all the 'new' diseases (Zika, West Nile, Ebola, HIV) come from human expansion into previously isolated territory. 

Am I suggesting that everything is everybody's problem? Yes I am. Claiming that I always do the right thing? Hell no. I just keep trying. 

As you get more information, your definitions have to change. Let all of them change.
