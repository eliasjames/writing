I'm interested in the practice of uncertainty, at the intersection of science and the humanities.

Most things in life repeat. To get good at life, get good at repetition.

Exciting times in life happen when intentional repetition - practice - results in a new outcome. But we have no idea when. From scientists to songwriters, we know practice is essential to breakthroughs, but it's not a guarantee.

Practice can seem absurd in the face of uncertainty, pointless. Why bother putting in the effort when you might get hit by a car tomorrow?

Most things in life are uncertain. The things we know for sure shrink under the infinite shadow of everything we don't know. To get good at life, get good with uncertainty.

Practice uncertainty.
