Ideal Eyes
Mar 20, 2019

If we could look to the skies with ideal eyes and see as far as eyes could see
We could observe the difference in the boundaries between my universe and thee
Now wouldn’t that be keen… if once we knew what we mean

Now time is short, and time is long, and time can fly and crawl
So I suspect the description that fits every situation cause it really fits none at all
Not sayin’ it’s null… it’s just a wall
Can’t win ’em all… so take it easy when you fall

It’s always shorter on the way back, the way I long knew
It’s always shorter on the way back, without the headwind that blew
It’s always shorter on the way back, in the direction I grew
It’s always shorter on the way back, the way back to you

Now I know time is real because I feel it when I’m far away
Away from you my love and from our home and then I have to stay
Day after day… they stretch and fray
To heal we pray… hey hey hey

It’s always shorter on the way back, the way I long knew
It’s always shorter on the way back, without the headwind that blew
It’s always shorter on the way back, in the direction I grew
It’s always shorter on the way back, the way back to you
