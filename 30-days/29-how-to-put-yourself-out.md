I get asked a lot, how does a person start sharing their creative work with the world? Let me start by listing reasons I've had in the past not to put my work out:

What if no one likes it? What if too many people like it? What if it's not as good as I hope it will be? I'm not ready. I don't have time. I don't have some other thing I need.

Look at all those reasons. Just writing those out makes me realize this needs to be a series. I'll start with the first one, but the same answer covers all of them: love, acceptance, flexibility.

Start by finding something you love deeply. There's nothing wrong with casual dabbling, but it lacks fuel. Sharing creative work involves tons of grunt grinding, which consumes motivation.

Creative fuel is like finding a hole in the world where the light leaks out, that can only be plugged with your work. Holes are hard to see though. If you don't see yours, just keep looking, experimenting, being a fan, asking questions. That process is worthy by itself.

Once you find material you love, ignore the numbers. I go out of my way to ignore how many likes my posts get, or email click rates, or any other number. On any site I can, I'll skip the dashboard, and open the post editing screen directly to avoid seeing them.

The problem with numbers is they disassociate you from the fact that there are people on the other side. That one solitary "like" or click or view could be really, really important to someone. Are you going to turn your nose up at changing one person's life because it's _not enough_?

Accept you're going to start at the bottom. Unless you had fame handed to you by circumstance - which comes with its own set of matching, monogrammed baggage - everyone starts there. Overnight success is the visible tip of the iceberg, and under the water is years of hard work. Accept you're going to start at the bottom.

The bottom has a huge hidden benefit: built-in flexibility. If the possibility of success is tiny, so is the chance of failure. Mess around, try different things, have fun!

Here's some perspective: if you're already doing creative work and _not_ sharing it, then you're getting 0 likes right now anyway.

Nowhere to go but up!
