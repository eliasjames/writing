Having the process of an artist will improve anyone's life.

Calling yourself an "artist" may seem pretentious, but only because the term is misunderstood. An artist is a scientist who experiments on the unmeasurable.

I'm a computer programmer by trade, and there's a common misconception that programming is computer science. The art of programming is _based_ on computer science, but they're not the same.

We judge science quantitatively. A measurement is taken, compared to a prediction, and results in either true or false.

Professor Donald Knuth literally wrote the book on what we today call 'algorithms', in a series called "The Art of Computer Programming". You can't get a whole lot farther away from the cliche of the artist than Knuth, an ordinary looking guy, working in one of the most rigorous and objective fields.

And yet it's no accident he chose the word "art" to describe programming. So what makes something an art?

In math, the same number can be expressed an infinite number of ways. The expressions "six thirds" and "the square root of four" both represent the same number.

But your teacher almost certainly required you to convert those answers to "two". Scientifically, they are all identical. But aesthetically, they are not. The simplest possible form is preferred.

All art has experimentation in common. Every programmer tries things a little differently, to see what works better. A painter experiments, whether they're working on a canvas or a house.

Artists _process_.
