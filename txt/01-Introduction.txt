The most important thing is to always consider: you may be wrong.

All of the success I have had came from that. And the worst evils perpetrated on the world come from individuals who are *absolutely sure* they're right.

If anyone tells you they have the perfect Truth, run the other way.

The reason we're all often so wrong is because of definitions. Everyone carries a set of definitions in their heads, which we all then try to map to others' definitions. 

But sometimes we get locked into a definition. We approach a situation like we know all about it and it blows up. Like the philosopher Axl Rose says, "Every time you think you know just what you're doing... That's when your trouble exceeds!"

But if you're doubting everything all the time, how do you proceed? Isn't it too much to live a life of constant uncertainty?

Here's the secret: you also live a life of constant uncertainty, you just pretend to know what you're doing. 

I'm pretending too. But some things I have to pretend less, because I know more about them. So coming full circle, here I restate the most important thing:

Words have no meaning outside of what people give them. So understanding the meaning a given to a word is everything. 

To truly understand, you may have to give up something you thought you knew for sure, for ever. And that can hurt hella bad.

They say ignorance is bliss, because real learning hurts. To learn anything you must suspect every detail.
