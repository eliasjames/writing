Lots of us don't like "perky" people. But I think it's a common misconception that perkiness is the same as positivity.

I used to work for a "perky" guy. Every morning he'd come in the office and announce, "How's everyone doing today? Are you having the _best day EVER?_"

One day, a close family member passed away. I took a few days off, and when I came back, he expressed very genuine condolences. But the next morning: "Is everybody _awesome_ today? 'Cause it's an _awesome_ day!" I know he didn't intend to make me feel bad, but nonetheless... Another morning he came in and didn't say anything. Someone in the office asked him how he was, and he mumbled in a monotone about "fantastic, livin' the dream" without even looking up from the floor. The irony would have been comical if his distress wasn't so obvious. 

Perkiness comes across as phony, because it is. The perk-er is trying to convince both the perk-ee and themselves that nothing bad exists. That's not positivity, it's denial.

Same deal with negative people though. They deny anything good exists and they'll attack you if you try to disagree. "That will never work." "Everybody sucks." "The world is going to hell." 

Negativity is a way of eliminating uncertainty. When you say, "That will never work" or "I can't do that", you have given yourself permission not to try. 

Now look, I'm not a Perky Pollyanna who's going to try and blow smoke you-know-where. It _may_ not work. You _might_ not be able to do that. 

But you don't _know_. You don't know until you try, openly try without holding secret reservations. Saying "I don't think that will work" or "I think that's beyond my ability" expresses an honest opinion based on experience, and invites discussion. "Never" and "can't" close the door on possibility.

Uncertainty can be stressful, difficult to accept, impossible to plan for; but it's also realistic. Closing the door on possibility is just as dishonest as pretending everything is awesome all the time.
