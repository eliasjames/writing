I used to wish what I love

Wasn't anachronistic

Antagonistic,

Willfully perverse

Butâ€¦

Nowadays when I hear

What passes for new music

Can't help but think I heard it

Somewhere else first



Generations of noise copy

Round the edges off the wave

When it's cool we kill the chill

And when it's hot we want it cold

  Now

Not knockin the new

But what we have got here

Is a failure to communicate due to

Doxxing the old



I wish I hadn't found my strength

In an age of weakness

When the poles of human values

Seem nearly reversed

But

Wish in one hand

Spit in the other

See for yourself which one of 'em

Fills up first



I used to need to want to need you

The neediness divine

But now I need to used to

This is my heart

This is my time
