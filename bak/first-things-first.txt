I asked myself, what the hell am I going to write about? The answer, unfortunately, is what I'm most scared of. 

Ernest Hemingway had some advice about overcoming writer's block: "All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know." Man, that sounds beautiful, but it's slightly disingenuous. 

I could write "Objects fall at a speed independent from their mass." That's hella true. It has been tested for hundreds of years and never found to be untrue. But it's not very original, is it? 

Hemingway omits that good writing needs to be both true and original. Originality comes from looking at the same old stuff in a new way. But how do you look at things in a new way, when so much has been done before? Galileo came up with the definition of gravity already, I don't have anything to add to that. 

The last component is importance. If I die tonight, what information would forever be lost from the world? What has not been said that still needs saying?

I know what I have to say now. It's scary because the things that need to be said are also the things that define who I am. I haven't been able to write confidently before because I've tried to exclude who I am, and the results were bland and abstract. 

Here are the things I think the world most needs to hear.
