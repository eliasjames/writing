Everyone is equal, but we all have different capacities.

Equality means to me that all people should be treated with respect and dignity, and get to pursue happiness as they see fit. But it's foolish to insist that all people are the same.

If someone walks off the street into a gym, the trainer will have them do some exercises to assess their strength. Some people are born naturally strong, and maybe they work a physical job, others maybe not so much. There's no shame in how strong or weak one is; it's just a capacity.

Some people have very little capacity for discomfort. Children think eating their vegetables or wearing Sunday clothes is excruciating, because they don't yet know real discomfort.

Some adults have never experienced real discomfort. Parents are alive and well as is the family dog, grandparents passed before they can remember. Popular in high school, got into their first choice college, dated the person they wanted to, broke up amicably.

We like to mock the social media influencer type who has a meltdown when they can't get the selfie they wanted. But when someone says it's the worst day of their life, that may be true, even if it doesn't look that way to the rest of us.

We feel pity for the unkempt hopeful at the stoplight with a cardboard sign, and then we feel contempt for the social climber who drives their expensive car past wothout stopping. Or, maybe, you feel contempt for the bum with the sign, and think they should be more like the successful.

None of these people are good or bad, including you and me. We just have different capacities for emotional weightlifting.
