I believe anyone can benefit from thinking of themselves as an artist. People have an aversion to thinking of themselves as an artist, they think it sounds pretentious. But an artist is simply a person who conducts experiments that can't be measured.

I'm a computer programmer by trade, and there's a common misconception that programming is computer science. The art of programming is _based_ on computer science, but they're not the same.

We judge science quantitatively. A measurement is taken, compared to a prediction, and results in either true or false.

What makes a good program doesn't have an obvious measurement. There's a lot of different angles you can approach it from: you can use technical metrics, like performance or bug density. Or there's social metrics, like net promotor score. The revenue a company makes from its software is another measurement.

Those all substitute for the question we're really trying to ask: do you like the program? Sometimes people like the slow, buggy version better, because the new one "feels wrong". The company that makes the most revenue may also spend the most on advertising.

Even less measureable are programming languages. Some programmers like Windows and Dot NET; others like Linux and HTML5. Measureable difference exist, but if you like one, the other simply will not do.

All art has experimentation in common. Every programmer tries things a little differently, to see what works better. A painter experiments, whether they're working on a canvas or a house.

Artists _process_.
