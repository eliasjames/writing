I can sum up everything I believe this way: simple is best, but simple is hard.
To succeed at the hard parts, it helps to look where it hurts. 

When someone else's actions upset you, ask what it is you dislike about yourself
that their action reminds you of. We despise in others what we dislike in 
ourselves. Far easier to work on that - how you feel about it - which is 
entirely under your control, than the actions of others (which are entirely not).

Look where it hurts.

Discomfort is the body's way of indicating a weak area, which requires healing. 
Discomfort often solves weakness in the form of exercise.
