American Fight Song

I’m an American and we like to fight
In the streets all day, between the sheets at night
Might makes right, baby there’s no spite
I’m an American and we like to fight

The world’s got their football, but there’s not enough fighting
We came up with our own game, martial blitz like lightning
Everybody loves it, both the left and the right wing
Don’t look too hard for any kind of insight thing

I’m an American and we like to fight
I’m an American and we like to fight

Some of us fight for personal glory
Others fight for freedom from fear and from worry
Some just enjoy getting bloody and gory
Me, I know no other way, simply my life story

I’m an American and we like to fight
I’m an American and we like to fight
We're all American and we like to fight
I’m an American and we like to fight
Yeah
