Twenty years ago it was a Friday. I know because Josh Beatty and I went out for lunch and I totaled my car.

I loved that car. But I knew it wasn't worth anything to the world, that insurance was going to screw me and I had nothing. I didn't know what I was going to do, how I'd get to work or to see my little girl. 

Also I had a gig that night. 

After the wrecker came, we cabbed it back to his place and got lit. Then we headed down to the ironically named Fine Arts Cinema. Yes, before it was Geno's, before it was The Skinny, it was a place that showed dirty movies, and occasionally let dirty punk kids put on a music show.

(kids are always looking for a place to put on a show. nothing has changed or ever will change there.)

Several people told me it was mesmerizing, but it wasn't a conventionally great performance. I struggled to find a connection to the audience through a veil of darkness. 

I'm celebrating it because I showed up. I didn't cancel or phone it in.

That's been my ace card over the years. I just don't quit. I keep trying to get a little better than before. Some things don't work out and eventually have to change. Change is the hardest. But I keep trying to get better at that too. 

Some folks do quit, and that's okay. Everybody makes their own decisions. Maybe one day I'll stop trying too. 

But not anytime soon. I have things to get better at.
