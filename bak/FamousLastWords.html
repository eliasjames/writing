<h1>Famous Last Words</h1>
<p>If you died tonight, what would you want your last words to be?</p>

<p>I believe the only truth is nothing can be guaranteed to stay true forever. We know what we know today, but something new keeps happening tomorrow. After earthshaking changes, everything we know can be turned inside out. In the future, some of us must be wrong. But no one can be completely sure who. </p>

<p>If that's true - and it is the only thing I'm completely sure of - it becomes of the utmost importance to not act as though you know for sure what will be true forever and what won't. Not only because the more extremes you go to demonstrate your certainty, the worse for you if you're wrong.</p>

<p>Acting as if you have complete certainty actually holds you back from deeper levels of understanding. I first noticed this in other programmers, when someone would commit to increasingly unreasonable justifications while trying to solve a bug. There was always some conclusion they were trying to avoid. </p>

<p>Then I saw the same thing in myself.</p>

<p>And in everyone else, all of you, my friends. When I see you get upset, I can see at the root of it there's some truth you wish different. Ask yourself why, five times. Down there in the darkness you find the deepest truths.</p>

<p>To learn, consider you might be wrong. </p>
