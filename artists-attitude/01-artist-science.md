Having the attitude of an artist will improve anyone's life.

Calling yourself an "artist" may seem pretentious, but only because the term is misunderstood. An artist is a type of scientist.

Professor Donald Knuth literally wrote the book on what we today call 'algorithms', in a series called "The Art of Computer Programming". You can't get a whole lot farther away from the cliche of the artist than Knuth, an ordinary looking guy working in one of the most rigorous and objective fields out there.

And yet it's no accident he chose the word "art" to describe programming. So what makes something an art?

In math, the same number can be expressed an infinite number of ways. The expressions "six thirds" and "the square root of four" both represent the same number.

But your teacher almost certainly required you to convert those answers to "two". Scientifically, they are all identical. But artistically, they are not. The simplest possible form is preferred.

Through repeated experiments, observing reactions, the artist learns what people prefer.

Art is the science of preference.
